# The All Seeing Crab

is a raytracer written in Rust.

## Running

Run `./run.sh output.png` and the output of the render will be saved to `output.png`

## Developing

1. Run `./watch.sh`
2. Open `target/output.png` in an editor split, so you can see it auto-update

To run tests, run `cargo test` (or `cargo watch`) as usual.
